# THORboard

This repository contains the non-gui game implementations of all the games available in `THORboard`. These should be used to speed up training, whereas the 3D versions of each game should be used for visualization purposes (since they take longer to render).

Currently supports:
* Chess
* Checkers
* Go
* Tic-Tac-Toe

_TODO: add image visualizations for each of these games_
